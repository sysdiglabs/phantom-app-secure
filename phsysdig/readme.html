      For example, imagine that Sysdig Falco detects that a container just
      spawned a shell. You can use this action to start capturing system calls
      which are happening in that shell so that you can see which commands or
      network stuff your attacker is using.  Once you have downloaded the scap
      file, you can use <a href='https://sysdig.com/opensource/inspect/'>Sysdig Inspect</a>
      to analyze the activity and its correlations or even to get more details
      for your forensics reports.
